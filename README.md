Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

I feel that I was able to refactor the codebsae to make it more secure. Mostly be identifying the vulnerabilities at the manual code review.   
THe parts that I found the most challanging was fInding what dependencies to supress in the maven static testing. The suppression logic was easy, it was the act of identifying what vulnerabilities to spuress.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring the sample code, running the dependancy check is the best start to assure that you didnt add any new vulnerabliliies 
In future assignments an tasks, I would find the manual code review most helpful. Refactoing your code is an important skill, and can lead to more efficient and secure programs
I would show future employers the dependency check that was conmpleted on the sample code base. This shows an understanding on where to look for vulnerabilities and how to begin mitigating them
